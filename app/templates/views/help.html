    <p>
      When you create a service on GOV.UK&nbsp;Notify, you start off in trial
      mode. This means:
    </p>
    <ul class="list list-bullet">
      <li>
        you can only send messages to yourself and your team members
      </li>
      <li>
        you can only send 50 messages per day
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Anyone working in central government can create an account on
      GOV.UK&nbsp;Notify and try it out. So it’s important that you start off
      with some restrictions in place.
    </p>

    <h3 class="heading-medium">To remove these restrictions</h3>

    <p>
      You need to request to go live:
    </p>
    <ul class="list list-bullet">
      <li>
        You’ll need to agree to our terms of use
      </li>
      <li>
        If you plan to send more than 250,000 text messages per year, you’ll
        need to agree to pay for what you use – take a look at our pricing
      </li>
      <li>
        We’ll check your templates to make sure they’re consistent with our
        design patterns, style guide and information security principles
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="heading-medium">
      All other aspects of GOV.UK&nbsp;Notify are exactly the same
    </h2>

    <p>
      You can still:
    </p>
    <ul class="list list-bullet">
      <li>
        upload a batch of recipients
      </li>
      <li>
        do an API integration
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We’ll send the messages you have permission to send. The messages you
      don’t have permission to send will still be listed on your
      GOV.UK&nbsp;Notify dashboard but won’t actually get sent. This means you
      can check that everything is fully working without accidentally sending
      hundreds of text messages or emails.
